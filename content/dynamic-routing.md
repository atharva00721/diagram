## Introduction to Dynamic Routing

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page. Let's dive deep into how dynamic routing works with static generation.

### What is Dynamic Routing?

Dynamic routing allows you to create pages with paths that you don't know ahead of time. For example, if you're building a blog, you might want to create pages for each blog post where the URL depends on the post's slug.

## Implementation

Here's a basic example of how to implement dynamic routing:

```javascript
// pages/posts/[slug].js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = getAllPosts()
  return {
    paths: posts.map((post) => ({
      params: {
        slug: post.slug,
      },
    })),
    fallback: false,
  }
}
```

### Benefits of Static Generation

1. Better Performance
2. SEO Friendly
3. Can be cached by CDN
4. No server needed at runtime

## Best Practices

When using dynamic routes, consider these best practices:
- Use fallback pages for better UX
- Implement proper error handling
- Cache data where possible
- Optimize images and assets
