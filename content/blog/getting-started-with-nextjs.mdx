# Getting Started with Next.js: A Comprehensive Guide

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications. In this guide, we'll explore the key features that make Next.js the perfect choice for your next web project.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that enables features like server-side rendering and static site generation. It's designed to make it easy to build high-performance React applications with excellent developer experience.

## Key Features

### 1. File-based Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system that makes creating new pages as simple as adding files to your project:

```jsx
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>
}
```

### 2. Server-side Rendering (SSR)

Next.js makes server-side rendering straightforward:

```jsx
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()

  return {
    props: { data }
  }
}
```

### 3. Static Site Generation (SSG)

You can also generate static pages at build time:

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const posts = await getAllPosts()
  return {
    props: {
      posts
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```
